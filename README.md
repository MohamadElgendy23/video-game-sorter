About

Video Game Sorter is a full-stack web application built to help users easily browse and sort video games based on categories like genre, platform, and more. Whether you're a gamer or a developer, this app makes it simple to find the perfect game for your needs with a smooth and responsive design.

Features

Sorting and Filtering: Sort games by various categories like genre, platforms, and game modes. It's a fast and easy way to find the games that match your preferences.

Responsive Design: The app is built with React and styled using TailwindCSS, making it fully responsive and user-friendly on any device.

Powerful Backend: The backend is powered by Spring Boot and Java, handling game data and user interactions efficiently.

PostgreSQL: I use PostgreSQL to store game data in a structured, reliable way, ensuring the app runs smoothly even as data grows.

Amazon Q: Amazon Q is integrated into the app to enhance query performance, allowing for fast and accurate sorting, even with large datasets. This makes the user experience faster and more efficient.

How It Works

The app is built with modern tools and technologies to deliver a seamless experience:

Frontend: The user interface is built with React to ensure itâ€™s interactive and dynamic. I use Vite for fast build times, and TailwindCSS for responsive design that adapts well to mobile and desktop views.

Backend: The backend is created with Spring Boot and Java, providing a solid foundation for the app's APIs and ensuring it runs efficiently.

Amazon Q: Integrating Amazon Q helps the app handle complex queries and large datasets quickly, providing users with results almost instantly.

PostgreSQL: The database stores all the game information, ensuring that itâ€™s easy to retrieve data quickly while maintaining accuracy and security.
